# MVVM-C-RxSwift

Implement the following
- RXSwift in UITableView and UICollectionView
- Define properties for input, output, and a subject in ViewModel which could be part of a broader architectural pattern
- In UITableView, there is a corresponding ViewModel associated with it. This ViewModel is responsible for providing the data and presentation logic required to configure and update that specific cell. This separation of concerns helps in maintaining clean and modular code, improving testability, and making it easier to manage the UI and data logic separately.
